# WS2812B_LED_chaser_with_verilog
Controlling an addressable LED strip, such as WS2812B, is a very simple task when we have an microcontroller (Arduino, etc,) in hand. But ever wondered how this LEDs lights up individually according to the given instructions. That's what I'm gonna discuss in this here and will try to light up a WS2812B LED strip with a FPGA 💡. **Let's Start!!**
